## G-Tomo-3D

<img src='gtomo_logo.png' height='100' />

G-Tomo-3D exposes the lastest Gaia eDR3 extinction cubes (Lallement et al. 2022, Vergely et al. 2022) for 3D visualisation, slicing (2D), and annotation.

## Software stack

* Dash/plotly : front-end web dashboard
* Visualiser : 3D rendering and slicing
* Python : back-end computations
* Docker : containerisation of code into an image

## SDA Framework

See the EXPLORE docs.

## Data

Input data files can be retrieved from Zenodo [ZenodoID](https://zenodo.org/).

For local deployment these can be added to '_data/app_data/'.


## Create and test locally 

    $ git clone https://github.com/explore-platform/g-tomo-3d.git
    $ cd g-tomo/
    $ docker-compose up --build
